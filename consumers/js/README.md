# Consumer-js

This simple javascript web application demonstrates the usage of `dummy-js`.

To start the the application do the following and open the browser:

```shell
$ npm run start
```

Of course `dummy-js` needs to be available for this to work. See the `package.json` for details. Some parts of the example where motivated by hints from [this gist][surma].
